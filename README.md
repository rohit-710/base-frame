# Collecti-Craft Frame

## This a Frame on Base to Mint NFTs

This is a Farcaster Frame that allows your Farcaster users to mint an NFT on the Base directly to their email address. A custodial wallet is generated for the user the moment they enter their email address. The mint is fully gasless and provides a native Web 2 experience.

All you need to do is like the cast and re-cast it, and then enter your Email address and click on Mint to mint the NFT. The NFT will then be delivered to your wallet address in a few seconds. Users can also choose to mint a special NFT using their credit card. This allows creators to segregate their users/audience in different tiers.

In order to evolve the NFT as per user's interaction, there is also a button that lets users dynamically update their NFT's image. All you need to do is click on "Update NFT" and in a few minutes, the new NFT image will be reflected on your wallet.
